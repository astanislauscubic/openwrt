Size       : Size: 4.50 MB (7.69 MB available)

Release 4.0.2-rc2 up to 4.0.2-rc5 contain a problem that may cause flash
corruption during an upgrade. This could cause the WiBE to exhibit unexpected
behaviour after flashing or severe corruption may "brick" the device.

The safest way to upgrade a WiBE with this version is to power off, remove the
SIM then power up before flashing as normal.

If the SIM is inaccessible, the following instructions may be used:
 - Login to the web interface
 - Go to Network -> Interfaces and click Stop next to the WAN interface
 - Go to System -> Startup, find wan_monitor in the list and click Stop.
 - Wait at least 30 seconds
 - Go to System -> Backup/Flash Firmware and upgrade as normal.
